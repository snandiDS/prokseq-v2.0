OUTPUT:
=======
ProkSeq gives several folder with analysis results as output

The structure of the OUTPUT looks like below


ProkSeq OUTPUT
--------------


**ProkSeq**..

	1. **QC_preFilter**:
    		- fastQC out put html file
        

        2. **QC_afterFilter**: Remove bad quality read and filter good quality reads. It contains three subfolder

                 - **FilteredReads**: good quality filtered fastq files

                 - **QCfastQ_filtered** : quality checking html file of filtered reads

                 - **RemovedReads**: Bad quality reads that is removed for analysis


	3. **sam**:
    		- **.sam**: Sequence Alignment file generated from bowtie2/salmon

                - **.sam.stat**: ALignment statistics of individual sample.

	        - **Alignment.summary**: Summary information/statistics of alignment to the reference genome 
        
        4. **TotalCountNdExpressions**:
                - **countFile_CPM_TPM.csv** : The file contains total count according to genomic features as well as Count per miillion(CPM), and Transcript per million (TPM)

		- **countFile.NucleotideAvgCount.csv** : THis file contains Average nucleotide expression per gene as well as other total count, CPM and TPM.

        5. **DiffExpResults**:  
                - **DESeq2_results.txt**: Differential expression results from DESeq2

                    - **DESeq2lfcShrink_results**: Differential expression results from DESeq2 with Log2 Fold Shrinkage

                - **edgeR_results.txt**: Differential expression results from edgeR


                - **afterNoiseq.txt**: Differential expression results from NOISeq

  
                - **RUV_DESeq2_results.txt**: Differential expression results with RUV normalization by using RUVSeq and DESeq2


        6. **GenomeBrowserFile**:
                 - **bam**: Folder contain Binary alignment file (BAM) as well as  sorted and indexed BAM. Users are advised to use sorted.bam file for raw aligned file visulazation by genomic browser IGV 

                 - **.wig**: Single nucleotide visualization wiggle file for visualization or other purpose

                 - **.bw** : Single nucleotide visualization Big wiggle file that takes which is memory efficient for visualization

                 - **normalized.bw**: Single nucleotide visualization normalized Big wiggle file if user wants to visually compare RNA-seq data of different library depth.


        7. **Plots**: Contains all the plots generated by ProkSeq during analysis in pdf, png and tiff format.
