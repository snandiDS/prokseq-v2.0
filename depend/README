This directory should have all the required dependencies.
If all the dependencies are in the 'depend' folder, then 
one can opt for the following in the parameter file (for 
example, param.bowtie.yaml or param.salmon.yaml).

PATH ROOT : path_to_the_depend_folder
PATH DEFAULT: 'TRUE'

However, one can have the dependencies installed in other 
locations. If the dependencies are installed at different 
locations, define the path for each dependency/program in 
the parameter files (for example, param.bowtie.yaml / 
param.salmon.yaml).

To populate the directory with the required programs, 
simply run the script setup.sh. 

	sh setup.sh

This script will fetch the required dependencies from 
http://www.fallmanlab.org. The script will also ask if the
user wants to compile samtools. After running the script 
and accepting Y for compiling the samtools, the output on 
the screen would be as follows:

        -- Viewing
           flags          explain BAM flags
           tview          text alignment viewer
           view           SAM<->BAM<->CRAM conversion
           depad          convert padded BAM to unpadded BAM

This means the program ran successfully.

Default layout of the depend directory should look like below:
--------------------------------------------------------------
        ./depend/README
        ./depend/setup.sh
        ./depend/afterqc
        ./depend/bowtie2
        ./depend/FastQC
        ./depend/pypy2.7-v7.2.0-linux64
        ./depend/readFasta
        ./depend/RSeQC-2.6.2
        ./depend/salmon-latest_linux_x86_64
        ./depend/samtools
        ./depend/samtools-1.10
        ./depend/subread-1.4.6-p5-Linux-i386
